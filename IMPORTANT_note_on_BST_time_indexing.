Dealing with BST is a pain in the neck. 

In the raw N2EX data, the hour at which the day starts moves in the summer. 

I (Diarmid) have been using an hour-centric apporach, where the data is prepped so that my scripts can take 24h slices for input
in cluster analysis or schedule optimisation, with e.g. the 7th entry always corresponding to 05:00-06:00 (day-ahead price data 
starts at 23:00).
This means taking the 23h day in spring and the 25h day in autumn and falsely turning them into 24h days.

This is different to the way Sam's data is structured, as he leaves the 23h and 25h days in the table. Taking that data one day at
a time would require a query approach rather than a slice one.
